#CAPABILITY
    Tic-tac-toe (or Noughts and crosses, Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players,
    X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing 
    three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.The game is to
    be played between the computer and a human opponent. Either of the two can start first.
    There are two things to implement for creating the game: the game logic and the game user interface.
    There are various possibilities for creating the UI on Windows, including Win32 API, MFC, ATL, GDI+,
    DirectX, etc. In this article, I will show how we can use the same game logic implementation to build
    applications using various technologies. We will create two applications, one with Win32 API and one
    with C++/CX for the Windows Runtime.
