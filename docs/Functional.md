# Functional specification

## Current situation

We plan to write a software to manage the To-Do List.

We plan to develop the software step by step. We will provide a minimum viable product (MVP) first, and then we will add functions to the MVP and improve the user experience.

## Dream system / Wanted system

The software should have the following functions:

- Add To-Do task (MVP)
- Delete To-Do task (MVP)
- Finish To-Do task (MVP)
- Show the existing To-Do task (MVP)
- Provide help documentation (MVP)
- Users register, login, log off
- Save the tasks in different txt files
- Countdown
- When the countdown is over, remind the user

## Current processes (model)

New task: User come up with a new task -> User take out the pen and notebook -> user write it down

## Required processes (model)
